				<p>I am Steven Miller, and I am looking for a job in Customer Services. I have 10 years of experience in related job positions. I started working as a Customer Care Agent in a call center gradually moving to a Customer Experience Analyst. I am a team player. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide. I have enough experience to occupy a managing position and I will be glad to work on increasing the customer loyalty rate of your company.</p>
